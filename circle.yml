    # This is to work around the fact that CocoaPods wants to set up the master CocoaPods specs
    # repo on pod lib lint, which takes several minutes on CircleCI. Without dependancies, this
    # isn't a nescessary step. We can point it at any other (smaller) Git repo to speed up this
    # step significantly. Because recursion is fun, let's point it at ourselves.
